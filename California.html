	<h1>California</h1>
	<p>
		<strong>California</strong> is a state in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States" target="_blank">Western United States</a>. It is bordered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada" target="_blank">Nevada</a> to the east, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" target="_blank">Pacific Ocean</a> to the west, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon" target="_blank">Oregon</a> to the north, and the Mexican state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California">Baja California</a> to the south. With over 39.5 million residents across a total area of approximately 163,696 square miles (423,970 <abbr aria-label="square kilometres">km2</abbr>), it is the most populous and the third-largest U.S. state by area.

		It is also the most populated subnational entity in North America and the 34th most populous in the world. The Greater Los Angeles area and the San Francisco Bay Area are the nation's second and fifth most populous urban regions respectively, with the former having more than 18.7 million residents and the latter having over 9.6 million.

		 <u>Sacramento</u> is the state's <strong>capital</strong>, while <i>Los Angeles is the most populous city in the state</i> and the second most populous city in the country (after New York City). Los Angeles County is the country's most populous, while San Bernardino County is the largest county by area in the country. San Francisco, which is both a city and county, is the second most densely populated major city in the country (after New York City) and the fifth most densely populated county in the country, behind four of New York City's five boroughs.

	<h2>Economy</h2>

		The economy of California, with a gross state product of $3.2 trillion as of 2019, <u>is the largest sub-national economy in the world</u>. If it were a country, it would be the 37th most populous country and the fifth largest economy as of 2020. The Greater Los Angeles area and the San Francisco Bay Area are the nation's second- and third-largest urban economies ($1.0 trillion and $0.5 trillion respectively as of 2020), after the New York metropolitan area ($1.8 trillion). The San Francisco Bay Area Combined Statistical Area had the nation's highest gross domestic product per capita ($106,757) among large primary statistical areas in 2018, and is <strong>home to four of the world's 10 largest companies</strong> by market capitalization and <strong>four of the world's 10 richest people</strong>.

	<h2>Notable contributions</h2>
	<p>
		Notable contributions to popular culture, for example in entertainment, and sports, have their origins in California. The state also has made noteworthy contributions in the fields of communication, information, innovation, environmentalism, economics, and politics. It is the home of <strong><i>Hollywood, the oldest and largest film industry in the world</i></strong>, which has had a profound effect on global entertainment. It is considered the origin of the hippie counterculture, beach and car culture,[not verified in body] and the personal computer, among other innovations. The San Francisco Bay Area and the Greater Los Angeles Area are widely seen as centers of the global technology and entertainment industries, respectively. California's economy is very diverse: 58% of it is based on finance, government, real estate services, technology, and professional, scientific, and technical business services. Although it accounts for only 1.5% of the state's economy, California's agriculture industry has the highest output of any U.S. state. California's ports and harbors handle about a third of all U.S. imports, most originating in Pacific Rim international trade.
